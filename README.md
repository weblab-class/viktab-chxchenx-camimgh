Singularity is a collaborative event organizing platform that seeks to address common problems in event planning between friends. We encourage accountability and collaborative work through an innovative point-earning system and unique, unlockable profile pictures, in addition to providing boards to plan events and fulfill tasks. Singularity is the solution for young adults who want an organized, aesthetic workspace without sacrificing hours on set-up -- a few clicks, a shared link, and youâ€™re ready to go!
